# Data analysis and powerBI bootcamp
This repo is created to track and save my training program progressin the field of data analysis and visualization. 

## Overview 
The goal of this bootcamp is to gain and improve my skillsets as a data analyst. I have recently graduated with a degree in applied CS. The program has secured me with a solid foundation in programming
and data analysis, but an an eager-to-learn person, I planned to become a proficient data analyst with great analysis power and skills in SQL, PowerBI, Tableau and etc. 

The prgram agenda is as the following :

Week 1: SQL & Power BI Foundations
- Advanced SQL (Data Analyst Track): Focus on joins, window functions, aggregations
- Power BI Fundamentals (Power BI Track): Get familiar with interface and basic reports
- Mini-project: Write SQL queries to analyze a dataset, document in GitHub repo

Week 2: Applied Analysis with SQL + BI Tools
- Customer Churn Analysis with SQL + Tableau (Data Analyst Track)
- Recreate similar dashboard in Power BI (Power BI Track)
- Power Query & Data Modelling (Power BI Track)
- Mini-project: Compare Tableau vs Power BI churn dashboards

Week 3: Python & A/B Testing + Business Reporting
- Data preprocessing with pandas (Data Analyst Track)
- A/B testing in Python (Data Analyst Track)
- Building business reports in Power BI (Power BI Track)
- Mini-project: A/B test analysis with visualization + business report in Power BI


I will create individual repos for each portofolio project I will be making in the next 3 weeks!
